Patrick Sobczyk's Project Portfolio

My Name is Patrick Sobczyk and I am beginning my adventure with coding. I work in Digital Forensics and have a high level of knowledge of certain technologies related to the field, however I always lacked in coding expertise. So I have decided to expand my knowledge and begin coding. I am currently enrolled into a full stack web development bootcamp through the University of Washington.

This is an page designed to showcase some of my coding projects. As it currently stands, I am early in my  coding career and I do not have projects to showcase. However as time goes on, I will be replacing elements and links to reflect my projects.

My portfolio page contains:

- My Name
- My Photo
- Links to other sections of the page
- An about me section
- A logo section for decoration related to my work experience and skills. 
    * The logos I decided to put into the page this release were:
        - The Internet Crimes Against Children Northwest Taskforce Logo
        - The National Computer Forensics Institute logo
        - The CompTIA CSIS Stackable Certification logo (A+, N+, S+)
        - The Cellebrite CCPO+CCPA Mobile Forensics Certification
        - The HTML Logo
        - The CSS logo
        - The JavaScript Logo
- Four project boxes that are clickable links that lead to my projects
    * currently these projects are just placeholder, but are being hosted for link functionality.
- A contact me section
    * Contains:
        - My Phone Number
        - My Email Address
        - A link to my Github Account
        - A link to my LinkedIn profile

The page is responsive and will work on mobile devices (change set at 600px this release).

This page will be updated in the coming months and years to showcase the developement of my skills.
